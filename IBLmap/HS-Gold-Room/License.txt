If you do find a commercial use for them, please consider purchasing the individual sIBL/HDR from the www.hdrsource.com website. After all, it's really cheap enough and will enable people like me to go out and shoot more sIBL/HDRs for the community. I'm not getting rich doing this by any means lol.
